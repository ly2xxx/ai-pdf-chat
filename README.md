1. Download the Llama2 model from - https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF/resolve/main/llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf
2. Create 3 .py files as:
  a. app.py -> To create app interface
  b. loadllm.py -> To load the Llama2 model locally
  c. fileingestor.py -> To upload PDF file and create chain for question answering
3. Run command "streamlit run app.py" -> This will run the app on http://localhost:8501
4. I have used UPI booklet - https://www.npci.org.in/PDF/npci/upi/Product-Booklet.pdf

Figured this out myself. The error message was kinda backwards: the problem isn't that the dll isn't a valid Win32 application, but that it is and it shouldn't be!

I was using "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022", and I guess that compiles it to 32 bit. The solution is to use x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022 instead. pip install llama-cpp-python in that environment installs a dll that fails to load models because of "Windows Error 0xc000001d", which in my case seems to mean that the binary is trying to use AVX2 without success. set FORCE_CMAKE=1 and set CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_AVX2=OFF" followed by the pip install gives me a llama-cpp-python that... well, fails to load a model due to "Windows Error 0xe06d7363", but that seems like a separate issue and at least it's actually importing the module now.

(Windows Error 0xe06d7363 was due to all the models I was trying to use being wrong versions. My kingdom for a set of standardised tiny test models)

python -m venv myvirtenv

This is the sample Flask application for the Azure Quickstart [Deploy a Python (Django or Flask) web app to Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python).
